Blockchain for Secure Data Sharing

Project Overview

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data sharing. Using the Ethereum blockchain, Solidity smart contracts, and IPFS, the project ensures that sensitive data is shared in a decentralized way, with immutability, transparency, and security guaranteed. Each transaction (or data sharing event) is recorded on the blockchain, providing an auditable and immutable record of all data interactions.

Key Features:

Decentralized Data Sharing: Data can be securely shared between parties without relying on a central authority.

Immutability: Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted.

Transparency: All data interactions and ownership records are visible and auditable on the blockchain.

Smart Contracts: Automate agreements for secure data sharing based on predefined conditions.

IPFS: Large data is stored off-chain in a decentralized file system, with only the data's hash stored on the blockchain.



---

Technologies Used:

Ethereum Blockchain: Used for storing immutable records of shared data.

Solidity: Smart contract programming language for writing the logic to govern data sharing.

Web3.js: JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum from the frontend.

Metamask: Ethereum wallet extension to manage transactions and interact with the blockchain.

Truffle Suite: Framework for Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and testing.

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): Decentralized file storage for large data, storing only metadata or hashes on the blockchain.

Requirements:

1. Node.js (for running the frontend and installing dependencies)


2. Truffle (for Ethereum smart contract development and deployment)


3. Ganache (or another Ethereum local network)


4. MetaMask (for managing Ethereum accounts and interacting with the blockchain)


5. IPFS Service (such as Infura or Pinata) to store data off-chain.

How to Deploy:

Step 1: Install Dependencies

1. Truffle Suite: Install Truffle to compile and deploy the smart contract.

npm install -g truffle


2. Install Web3.js:

npm install web3


3. IPFS: You can use an IPFS service like Pinata or Infura for uploading files to IPFS.



Step 2: Set Up Truffle Project

1. Initialize a new Truffle project:

truffle init


2. Create a smart contract (e.g., DataSharing.sol) in the contracts/ folder.



Step 3: Compile and Migrate Smart Contract

1. Compile the smart contract:

truffle compile


2. Deploy the contract to a local Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache):

truffle migrate --network development



Step 4: Set Up Frontend

1. In the frontend/ folder, update the app.js file with the contract address and ABI from the deployment.


2. Ensure MetaMask is connected to the correct Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache or Rinkeby testnet).



Step 5: Running the Frontend

1. Open index.html in a web browser.


2. Use MetaMask to connect to your Ethereum account and interact with the smart contract.


3. Upload a file using the frontend interface, and the file will be stored on IPFS, with the IPFS hash recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

How It Works:

1. Smart Contract: The DataSharing smart contract stores data hashes on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to share data securely by recording only the hash of the data on-chain.


2. IPFS: The data itself (e.g., a file or document) is uploaded to IPFS. Only the IPFS hash is stored on the blockchain, making it tamper-proof and easily accessible.


3. Frontend: The frontend lets users upload files, which are then stored on IPFS. The IPFS hash is stored on the blockchain, and users can view the data they have shared or received.




---

Example Output:

When a user shares data, the smart contract logs the data hash on the blockchain. The frontend displays:

{
  "complianceType": "COMPLIANT",
  "annotation": "Data shared successfully with hash: ipfs://QmHash"
}

This hash links to the data stored in IPFS.


---

Customization:

Extended Data Sharing: You can extend the smart contract to allow more complex rules for data sharing (e.g., permissions, conditional sharing).

Data Retrieval: Add functionality to let users retrieve the actual data from IPFS using the stored hash.
